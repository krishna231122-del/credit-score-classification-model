# 💳 Credit Risk Prediction

This project predicts a customer's credit risk level using Machine Learning.

The goal is to classify customers based on their financial and demographic information into different credit score categories.

## 🚀 Project Overview

Banks and financial institutions need to assess whether a customer is risky before approving loans.  

This project builds a machine learning model to predict:

- Low Risk
- Average Risk
- High Risk

## 📊 Workflow

### 1️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Clean column names
- Clean target column
- Encode categorical features
- Split features (X) and target (y)

### 2️⃣ Model Training
- Train/Test split (80/20)
- Random Forest Classifier
- Evaluate model accuracy
- Save trained model

### 3️⃣ Prediction
- Load saved model
- Align feature columns
- Predict risk category for new customers

## 🧠 Model Used

RandomForestClassifier from Scikit-learn.

Why Random Forest?
- Handles categorical data well
- Robust to overfitting
- Works well without heavy tuning
